            <p class="text">You know the old saying, “It takes all kinds.” At Country Living, we find that it’s as true for garden flowers as it is for people.
                <br>
                Planting many different types of flowers in your garden guarantees a good show with a range of colors, textures, and heights. 
                <br>
                With a mix spring, summer, fall, and even winter bloomers, you'll have something pretty to enjoy in the garden all year long.

            </div>
                <p class="text">The lily is a genus of flowering plant. There are many species of lilies, like trumpet lilies and tiger lilies. They are usually quite tall, and are perennials. 
                    <br>
                    Most lilies grow from a bulb, which in some species develops into a rhizome, which carries small bulbs. A highly efficient technique for multiple shoot and propagule formation in lilies through plant tissue culture technique was given by Yadav et al.
                <br>
                    In 2013 Lilies grow in Europe, North America, and Asia. There are more than 100 species, and many cultivated varieties. They also come in various colours. It tends to grow wild in the forest and a grassy plain of a mountainous area, but several kinds grow wild on wet ground. A lily's petals come in multiples of three. The fleur de lys is a stylized depiction of the lily.

            </div>
                <p class="text">Vanda coerulea, commonly known as blue orchid,[1] blue vanda or autumn lady's tresses, is a species of orchid found in Northeast India with its range extending to China (southern Yunnan). It is known as kwaklei in Manipuri and vandaar in Sanskrit. It has bluish purple flowers which are very long-lasting compared to other orchids. The plant bears up to 20 to 30 spikes.
                <br>
                In Victorian times, orchids were seen as a symbol of wealth and luxury. Blue flowers, on the other hand, mean rarity, beauty, spirituality, power, peace, and uniqueness. Blue orchids combine the meanings of orchids and blue flowers. They illustrate spirituality, fertility, peace, and uniqueness.

                <h2 class="decs">IRIS</h2>
            </div>

                <p class="text">Iris is a flowering plant genus of 310 accepted species with showy flowers. As well as being the scientific name, iris is also widely used as a common name for all Iris species, as well as some belonging to other closely related genera. A common name for some species is flags, while the plants of the subgenus Scorpiris are widely known as junos, particularly in horticulture. It is a popular garden flower.
                    <br>
                    The often-segregated, monotypic genera Belamcanda (blackberry lily, I. domestica), Hermodactylus (snake's head iris, I. tuberosa), and Pardanthopsis (vesper iris, I. dichotoma) are currently included in Iris.

            </div>
    
                <p class="text">Snowdrops have been known since the earliest times under various names, but were named Galanthus in 1753.
                    <br>
                    As the number of recognised species increased, various attempts were made to divide the species into subgroups, usually on the basis of the pattern of the emerging leaves (vernation).
                    In the era of molecular phylogenetics this characteristic has been shown to be unreliable and now seven molecularly defined clades are recognised that correspond to the biogeographical distribution of species. New species continue to be discovered.
